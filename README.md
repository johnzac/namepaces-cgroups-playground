Just trying out some of the stuff that makes a container tick. If you've never tried building a container or compiling a kernel from a t2 micro amazon instance, I strongly recommend it.
rootfs.tar is a custom baked container with minimal packages installed. It contains curl,nginx,php-fpm,lynx,grep(pcre enabled) apart from a minimal busybox based installation.
